### ‚ú® About the Project

This project was developed to apply theoretical knowledge of information security in a practical, hands-on environment. By simulating a banking system, we focused on building a secure foundation, implementing safeguards against threats, and ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. This project serves as a clear example of security by design.

### üîí Key Security Features

* **Secure Authentication:** User login and session management are handled securely to prevent unauthorized access.
* **Input Validation:** All user inputs are sanitized and validated to protect against injection attacks (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS).
* **Data Protection:** üîí Sensitive data is handled with best practices to ensure privacy and security.
* **Access Control:** Implemented roles and permissions to restrict access to specific functionalities.
* **Error Handling:** Graceful and secure error messages to avoid leaking sensitive information.
